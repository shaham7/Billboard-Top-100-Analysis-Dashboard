# Billboard-Top-100-Analysis-Dashboard
This dashboard explores genre distributions, artist contributions, popular collaborations, and trends in song popularity from the Billboard Top 100. Built using Python, pandas, and Streamlit, it’s a humble start to analyzing the music I love.

For a long time, I found myself starting projects only to abandon them midway.
Thoughts like “It’s not big enough,” “It won’t stand out,” or “There are better projects out there” held me back.

But then I had a realization: there’s no shame in being a beginner. Every expert was once a beginner, and what truly matters is taking that first step.

So, I decided to start small—something humble but meaningful to me. Anyone who knows me knows how much I love music. I eagerly wait for Spotify Wrapped and Apple Replay every year. I listen to almost every genre (well, except maybe Psychedelic Trance—I’m still working on appreciating that one).

With that in mind, I created a Billboard Top 100 Analysis Dashboard.

It’s a humble project to begin with, but it helped me combine two things I love: music and data analysis. Here’s what the dashboard does:

Visualizes the top genres in the charts.
Highlights which artists dominate those genres.
Analyzes artist collaborations.
Tracks trends in popularity by genre and artist.
Also, let’s take a moment to appreciate how my boy Kendrick Lamar is killing it this year—absolute legend!

This project may not be groundbreaking, but it’s personal, and it’s a step forward.
